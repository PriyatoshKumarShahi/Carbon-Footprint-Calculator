# Carbon-Footprint-Calculator



Overview
The Carbon Footprint Tracker is a web application designed to help users calculate, track, and reduce their carbon emissions from daily activities. It promotes awareness about the environmental impact of individual carbon footprints, offering actionable tips for leading a more sustainable lifestyle.

Features
Carbon Footprint Calculator: Users can input data related to their transport, energy usage, and waste generation to calculate their overall carbon emissions.
Personalized Advisory: The app provides feedback and tips based on the user's carbon footprint to help them reduce their emissions.
Pie Chart Breakdown: Visual representation of emissions from different categories (transport, electricity, waste) using dynamic charts.
Advisory Section: Offers practical tips for reducing carbon emissions, from energy-efficient practices to waste management.
Awareness Quiz: Engages users in understanding more about carbon footprints and sustainable practices.
FAQ Section: Answers common questions about carbon footprints, calculations, and ways to reduce emissions.





Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure of the web pages.
CSS3: For styling and responsive design.
JavaScript: For interactivity and dynamic features.
Chart.js: For generating interactive pie charts displaying carbon emission breakdowns.
Font Awesome: For adding icons to enhance the UI.





How It Works
Input: Users enter their transport distance (in km), monthly electricity usage (in kWh), and food waste (in kg).
Calculation: The app calculates the user’s carbon footprint using standard conversion factors:
Transport: 0.12 kg CO₂ per km.
Electricity: 0.233 kg CO₂ per kWh.
Waste: 1.2 kg CO₂ per kg.
Result: The app displays the total carbon footprint in kg CO₂ and provides a visual chart breakdown.
Advice: Personalized tips are given based on the user’s total emissions, with warnings for high values in specific categories.





Challenges Encountered
Accurate Calculations: Finding reliable data and conversion factors to ensure the calculations reflect real-world carbon emissions was a key challenge.
Data Storage: Implementing local storage to retain user input across sessions required careful planning to handle the data persistently.
User Experience: Creating a user-friendly and visually engaging interface was crucial for encouraging user engagement and promoting environmental awareness.
